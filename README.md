# Odin Recipes - Kenyan Dishes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), under the HTML Foundations section.

It’s a simple recipe website built with basic HTML, showcasing traditional Kenyan dishes:

- Ugali
- Nyama Choma
- Sukuma Wiki

## Features
- An index page with links to individual recipe pages
- Each recipe page includes:
  - A title and image of the dish
  - A short description
  - List of ingredients
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - A link back to the homepage

## Skills Practiced
- Writing semantic HTML
- Creating links between pages
- Structuring content with headings, lists, and paragraphs
- Adding images with proper alt attributes

This is just the beginning — styling with CSS will be added later.
